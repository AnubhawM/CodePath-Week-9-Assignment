# CodePath-Week-9-Assignment

Which Honeypot(s) were deployed: Dionaea

Any issues you encountered: Setting up Google Cloud Platform was a bit confusing. Also, when I tried to create the .json file at the end, it kept telling me that 0 records were exported, when I could see that attacks were being made. So, I have included a screenshot of how many pages of attacks were generated. 

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.: Since the .json file wasn't being made correctly, I estimate the number of attacks to be about 1557 because each page has 10 entries and there were 155 full pages and page 156 had only 7 entries. 

Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected: How do attackers find the honeypot? 

This is a screenshot of the Attacks page to show how many attacks were made to the Honeypot:
